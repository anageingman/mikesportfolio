   <p>Hi, I am Mike. I have been alive a long time now, 61 years as I write this, and am currently enjoying retirement. 
    I am married to Gill and we have 4 kids and 7 grandkids.
    When I still worked I was an IT Director at a logistics business for 20 years. Whilst the job was challenging and we were consistently under funded, it was also enjoyable. The team I had were with me for many of those 20 years and I was proud of the work we did. However, 20 years of being on call 365 x 24 x 7 was exhausting and I lept at the chance to retire at 59 when we sold the business.
    </p>
