    <h1>Mike's Personal Site: Interests</h1>
    <p>I have had a number of interests throughout my life but these 3 have stuck over the years. I will show some stuff about my interests on the following pages.</p>
    <p>I also am interested in the following too:
        <ul>
            <li>Reading. I enjoy a good book but have found over the years that my ability to focus for longer periods has diminished. I often fall asleep</li>
            <li>Music. As I get older my passion for music grows and I love a broad range of musical types</li>
            <li>Politics. But my Wife says it makes me angry</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
